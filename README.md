Course Instructor: *Prof. Suresh Purini*, IIIT Hyderabad


### Assignment 02 Questions

1. Write an x86-64 assemble language program to compute the Nth fibonacci number. N is provided through data section and you should store the computed fibonaccii number in the data section.

2. Challenge Problem: Solve the above problem but take N as user input through keyboard and print the computed fibonacci number on the screen.

3. Your fibonacci computation function should be in x86-64 assembly and you should call this function from the main function written in a C program.

4. In Question 03, modify such that your main function should be in assembly. Call the fibonacci function written in C.

5. Write a recursive version of Fibonacci in x86-64 assembly.

6. Declare an array in data section of your assembly program. Write x86-64 assembly code to compute the sum and max of the array elements.
